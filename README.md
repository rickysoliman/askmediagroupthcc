# Ask Media Group Take Home Coding Challenge

## Problem
Your goal is to write a tool that accepts as input a repository name, and using the GitHub API,
determines the day of the week that has had the most commits over the last year (the prior 52
weeks). It should output the most active day of the week to stdout as well as the average
number of commits for that day of the week over the last year of activity on the project.
